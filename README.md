# 6dof_Equations_of_motion
6dof equations of motions to simulate the motion of a flipped coin using MatLab

Standard 13 equations 13 unknown system of equations are used, with the orientation of the coin described by euler-parameters instead of euler angles
The aerodynamic drag is modeled as a linear function of velocity (stokes law), however quadratic velocity dependance can also be used.
The solver used is ODE89
